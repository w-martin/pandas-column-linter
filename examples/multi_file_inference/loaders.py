"""CSV loaders — aggressive column inference with no schema classes.

The standalone checker infers a column set from ``usecols=`` (pandas) or
``columns=`` (polars) on every read call and validates subscript access against
it.  No ``BaseSchema`` class is required anywhere in this directory.

Run the whole directory at once:

    typedframes check examples/multi_file_inference/

Each file is checked independently; the checker reports errors across all of
them in a single pass.
